ðŸ”˜ **Introduction**

Delving into the rich landscape of real estate, this study focuses on collecting and analyzing data from nobroker.in, a prominent property website, to provide insights and recommendations. By leveraging web scraping techniques, we will explore the nuances of flats categorized by their bedroom configuration (1 BHK, 2 BHK, etc.), location, rental prices, deposit amounts, and furnishing status. Our analysis aims to shed light on broader industry trends, including area-wise property dynamics, maximum, average, and minimum rents, deposit amounts, and the relationship between rent and the number of bedrooms through informative scatterplots.

ðŸ”˜ **Findings**

1.  As the type of property increases, such as from 1 BHK to 2 BHK and beyond, the built-up area tends to increase as well. This suggests that larger property types are associated with more spacious living areas.
2. 1 BHK and 2 BHK units are in higher demand or more readily available in the market, potentially reflecting the preferences and affordability of potential buyers or tenants.
3. There is a linear relationship between number of bedrooms and rent,As the number of bedrooms increases, the rent also tends to increase. This implies that larger properties with more bedrooms command higher rental prices, likely due to the increased living space and amenities they offer.
4. The data shows that Andheri East and Andheri West have the highest number of property listings
5. The majority of properties listed on the website are fully furnished. This indicates a preference for ready-to-move-in properties with complete furnishings. It could be driven by the convenience and time-saving aspect for tenants who prefer to have all the necessary furniture and appliances already provided in their rental units.  


ðŸ”˜ **Summary**

1. The analysis reveals a positive correlation between property types and their built-up areas, indicating that larger property types offer more spacious living areas.
2. 1 BHK and 2 BHK properties dominate the listings, suggesting higher demand or availability in the market.
3. There is a linear relationship between the number of bedrooms and rent, with larger properties commanding higher rental prices. Andheri East and Andheri West have the highest property listings, and fully furnished properties are preferred by tenants.

ðŸ”˜ **Challenges Faced**

1. Collecting data from single platform for different location was time consuming.
2. Getting data well and consistent across different sources requires careful data cleaning and processing.
